```

### 1.2 Release Artifact Creation

#### Signed Release Artifacts
```bash
# Create release archive
git archive --format=tar.gz --prefix=mortgagematch-pro-v1.0.0/ v1.0.0 > mortgagematch-pro-v1.0.0.tar.gz

# Generate checksums
sha256sum mortgagematch-pro-v1.0.0.tar.gz > mortgagematch-pro-v1.0.0.sha256
md5sum mortgagematch-pro-v1.0.0.tar.gz > mortgagematch-pro-v1.0.0.md5

# Create signed manifest
gpg --armor --detach-sig mortgagematch-pro-v1.0.0.tar.gz
