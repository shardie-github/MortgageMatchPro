# Incident Response Runbook

## Overview

This runbook provides step-by-step procedures for responding to incidents in the MortgageMatch Pro platform. It covers common incident types, escalation procedures, and recovery steps.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time | Escalation |
|-------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| **P1 - Critical** | Complete service outage, data loss, security breach | 15 minutes | Immediate |
| **P2 - High** | Major feature unavailable, performance degradation | 1 hour | 30 minutes |
| **P3 - Medium** | Minor feature issues, non-critical bugs | 4 hours | 2 hours |
| **P4 - Low** | Cosmetic issues, enhancement requests | 24 hours | 8 hours |

### Incident Types

1. **Service Outage** - Complete or partial service unavailability
2. **Performance Issues** - Slow response times, high error rates
3. **Security Incidents** - Unauthorized access, data breaches
4. **Data Issues** - Data corruption, loss, or inconsistency
5. **Third-party Dependencies** - External service failures
6. **Infrastructure Issues** - Server, database, or network problems

## Initial Response Procedures

### 1. Incident Detection and Acknowledgment

**Step 1: Detect Incident**
- Monitor alerts from Sentry, PostHog, and custom monitoring
- Check system health dashboard
- Review error logs and metrics

**Step 2: Acknowledge Incident**
- Create incident ticket in tracking system
- Assign severity level based on impact
- Notify on-call engineer via Slack/email

**Step 3: Initial Assessment**
- Determine scope and impact
- Identify affected users/systems
- Document initial symptoms

### 2. Immediate Actions

**For P1/P2 Incidents:**
1. **Activate Incident Response Team**
   - Incident Commander (IC)
   - Technical Lead
   - Communications Lead
   - Customer Success Lead

2. **Create Incident Channel**
   - Create dedicated Slack channel: `#incident-YYYY-MM-DD-description`
   - Invite all response team members
   - Set up status page updates

3. **Initial Communication**
   - Send immediate notification to stakeholders
   - Update status page if public-facing
   - Notify customer success team

## Detailed Response Procedures

### Service Outage Response

**Step 1: Immediate Assessment**
```bash
# Check service health
curl -f https://mortgagematch-pro.vercel.app/api/health

# Check database connectivity
supabase status

# Check external dependencies
curl -f https://api.openai.com/v1/models
curl -f https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges
```

**Step 2: Identify Root Cause**
- Check application logs: `vercel logs --follow`
- Review database logs in Supabase dashboard
- Check external service status pages
- Review recent deployments

**Step 3: Implement Fix**
- If code issue: Deploy hotfix
- If database issue: Execute recovery procedures
- If external dependency: Implement fallback mechanisms

**Step 4: Verify Resolution**
- Run health checks
- Test critical user flows
- Monitor error rates
- Confirm with stakeholders

### Performance Issues Response

**Step 1: Performance Analysis**
```bash
# Check response times
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s https://mortgagematch-pro.vercel.app/api/health

# Check database performance
supabase db analyze

# Check memory usage
vercel logs --follow | grep "memory"
```

**Step 2: Identify Bottlenecks**
- Database query performance
- API response times
- External service latency
- Memory/CPU usage

**Step 3: Implement Optimizations**
- Database query optimization
- Caching improvements
- Code performance fixes
- Infrastructure scaling

### Security Incident Response

**Step 1: Immediate Containment**
- Isolate affected systems
- Preserve evidence
- Change compromised credentials
- Notify security team

**Step 2: Assessment**
- Determine scope of breach
- Identify compromised data
- Assess attack vector
- Document timeline

**Step 3: Remediation**
- Patch vulnerabilities
- Reset compromised accounts
- Implement additional security measures
- Notify affected users

**Step 4: Post-Incident**
- Conduct security review
- Update security procedures
- Notify compliance team
- Document lessons learned

### Data Issues Response

**Step 1: Assess Data Impact**
- Identify affected data sets
- Determine data integrity status
- Check backup availability
- Assess business impact

**Step 2: Data Recovery**
- Restore from most recent backup
- Validate data integrity
- Test data consistency
- Update affected records

**Step 3: Prevention**
- Identify root cause
- Implement data validation
- Improve backup procedures
- Add monitoring

## Escalation Procedures

### Escalation Matrix
