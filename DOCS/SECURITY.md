# Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures, access controls, and audit procedures for the MortgageMatch Pro application.

## Access Control

### Supabase Roles
- **anon**: Read-only access to public data, no sensitive operations
- **authenticated**: User-specific data access with RLS policies
- **service**: Server-side operations, full database access
- **admin-maintenance**: CI/CD operations only, limited to maintenance tasks

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All sensitive tables have RLS policies enabled:
- Users can only access their own data
- Service role has full access for server operations
- Anonymous users have limited read access to public data

### Secret Management
- All secrets stored in GitHub Secrets and Vercel environment variables
- Service keys never exposed to client-side code
- Regular secret rotation via automated scripts
- Least privilege principle applied to all access

## Security Boundaries

### Client-Side
- No sensitive data in client bundles
- Feature flags control access to sensitive features
- Input validation on all user inputs
- XSS protection via Content Security Policy

### Server-Side
- API rate limiting per IP and user
- Request size limits
- SQL injection protection via Prisma
- CORS configured for specific origins only

### Database
- Encrypted connections (SSL required)
- Connection pooling with limits
- Query logging for security monitoring
- Regular security updates

## Audit Trails

### Authentication Events
- All login/logout events logged
- Failed authentication attempts tracked
- Session management events recorded

### Data Access
- All database queries logged (in production)
- RLS policy violations tracked
- Sensitive data access audited

### Configuration Changes
- Feature flag changes logged
- Environment variable changes tracked
- Deployment events recorded

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Process
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring alerts
2. **Assessment**: Immediate impact evaluation
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication**: Remove threat and vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review
